# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN
To detect the presence of tumor, Mask R-CNN architecture is used, which is an instance segmentation method. Using Mask R-CNN, the image is automatically segmented and pixel-wise masks are constructed for every object i.e. tumor in an image, here MRI scan.

The project helps in distinguish gliomas which are the most difficult brain tumors to be detected with deep learning algorithms. Because, for a skilled radiologist, analysis of multimodal MRI scans can take up to 20 minutes and therefore, making this process automatic is obviously useful.
